# hello-world
This repo is a place for me to store ideas and resources.

I am a new programmer but not a young person. I am nearing the end of a twelve week bootcamp called Academy Pittsburgh, in the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I have worked a bit in C#, Ruby, SQL, rspec, Rails, and ASP.Net and been exposed to Rust. I love to solve problems with code and I can't wait to learn more about coding and use it every day.
